# lod-hack

Experiments and documentation for the Linked Open Data mini-Hackathon 25-26 April 2016.

Links to API docs elsewhere are on the [wiki](https://github.com/naturalis/lod-hack/wiki).

The layout is, provisionally, as follows:

- `ont`: locally cached ontology files
- `indexes`: sitemaps or other listings
